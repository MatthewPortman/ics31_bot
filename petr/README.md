# Contains images of PETR
and python scripts to handle said images.

`return_a_petr.py` grabs a petr filename and weight from the pre-built csv and returns the filename based on the weighting. 

`build_petrs.py` rebuilds the csv (`petrs.csv`) and contains functionality for performing the weighting. Simply run it as a script and the csv will be rebuilt and the bot, ready to go!
